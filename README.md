# CardConquest-unity
local version of cardconquest

This will be my main version of the CardConquest game going forward instead of the "Blog Version"

## How to Play
* Download the latest release zip archive
* Extract the zip archive
* Click on CardConquest-unity.exe to run

To get connections to work over LAN, you may need to disable windows firewall. If you are the host, you may need to run the game as an Administrator to have the TCP port open for connections

## Current features implemented
* Reinforcements

## Features that may be added someday if I ever stop being lazy
* Special abilities for cards – right now, the cards are pretty simple. I’d like to add “abilities” to the cards that affect the battles. An example would be, if you play this card and ONLY played infantry units in your army, all infantry have a power of 2 instead of 1. Or something like, if the opposing player has no tanks in their army, you get +1 to your battle score if you have a at least 1 tank. Stuff like that
* Different decks/cards – players have the same cards right now. I’d like for there to be at least two different card sets so players kind of play differently based on what cards they have. The cards would have different powers, attack/defense values, and different abilities (if I ever add those)
* Allow players to choose from multiple player types/card deck types – After I’ve added at least two card decks, maybe I will create more and also allow the players to “pick” which deck they want while they are in the lobby. Basically, character selection that affects what cards you have in the game
* More than 2 players…
* Different maps to choose from
* Camera controls for larger maps or with more players
