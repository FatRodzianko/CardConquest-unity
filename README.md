# CardConquest-unity
local version of cardconquest

This will be my main version of the CardConquest game going forward instead of the "Blog Version"

## How to Play
* Download the latest release zip archive
* Extract the zip archive
* Click on CardConquest-unity.exe to run

To get connections to work over LAN, you may need to disable windows firewall. If you are the host, you may need to run the game as an Administrator to have the TCP port open for connections

## Current features implemented
* Reinforcements for battles
* Special Abilities for Cards
* Multiplayer through Steamworks so you don't have to do port forwarding any more

## Features that may be added someday if I ever stop being lazy
* More than 2 playersâ€¦
* Different maps to choose from
* Camera controls for larger maps or with more players

You can find a much longer how-to-play write up on my itch.io page https://rodzianko.itch.io/cardconquest
